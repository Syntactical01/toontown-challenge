# Toontown Programming Challenge

This is a text based game solution to the [ToonTown Coding Challenge](Programming_Application_Challenge.pdf).

This implementation of the game is just a text based version for sake of time. This implementation could easily be hooked up to a 2D game using `pygame` if needed.

**Tested using:** `Python 3.6.6`

**How to play the game:**
1) Make sure python is installed
2) Run the `game_controller.py` file with python.
    * Can be done on windows using `python game_controller.py` if Python3 is on PATH.

**Code Understanding:**
The code if fully commented. Feel free to look through the four `.py` files containe in the project.
